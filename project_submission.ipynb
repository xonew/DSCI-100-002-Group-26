    "Based on preliminary research, we determined that there's a relationship between heart disease and all of our selected variables. So, we expected that using all four predictors would allow us to predict heart disease diagnosis with decent accuracy. Through a classification exercise we were able to confirm these suspicions and determine that using the choice variables (age, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate.) that are inexpensive to test for results in an estimated accuracy of more than 70%."

    "While this figure is not great enough to replace angiograms entirely, it is significant enough to be effective as a screening test to determine at-risk individuals. Because this model has such a low cost to run, it can be included as a routine step in any checkup, potentially allowing individuals with undiagnosed heart disease to receive the attention they need."

    "The impact is clear: if we can routinely do cheap tests for heart disease or reduce the number of angiograms needed, it means less costly procedures for physicians and patients, leading to increased access to heart disease diagnoses. Thus directly affecting impoverished or otherwise less fortunate communities, possibly saving lives and changing the healthcare system towards greater accessibility."

    "Such explorations and investigations into current health care practices may cause future questions to arise. For example, we may rethink current standard diagnosis practices in medicine and explore easier, less expensive options, including but not limited to heart disease diagnosis and other cardio related disorders. Specifically, one possible question is \"What other variables can we use to successfully predict heart disease with even more accuracy?\""
